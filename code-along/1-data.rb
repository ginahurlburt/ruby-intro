puts 2
puts 3 + 2
puts 3 - 2
puts 3 * 2
puts 3 / 2.0

puts 5 * (2-2)

# Perform simple math with numbers

# Strings
puts "Hello, world"

# Combine strings together
puts "Hello, " + "world"
puts "tacos are delish"
puts "tacos" * 3

# Variables
food = "tacos"
number = 3

puts food
puts number 

number = 100
puts food * number

# Combine strings and variables
greeting = "Heyyyyyy"
welcome_message = "#{greeting}, world!"

# String manipulation
puts welcome_message.reverse
